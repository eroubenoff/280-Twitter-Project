"""Write list of users who tweeted to a CSV, user_list.csv. 
Also write a list of hashtags and their frequency, 
hashtag_list.csv

Also export numpy objects for faster processing.

The CSV has rows as (user id/hashtag, number of times tweeted).

This script assumes:
 - MongoDB is listening on localhost/27017
 - The database is called "twitter" with collection "tweets"
